# match.py
A simple string matching library written in python. This may expand to
include a variety of string-processing algorithms and data structures such
as suffix arrays/trees, finite automata based methods, and dictionary matching. Currently only the Z algorithm and Knuth-Morris-Pratt are implemented.
